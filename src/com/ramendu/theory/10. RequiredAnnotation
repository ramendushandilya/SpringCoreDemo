*. The @Required annotation applies to Bean property setter methods and it indicates that the affected property must
be populated in XML configuration.

*. @Autowired you know it, can be done on both setter and constructor

*. If more than one beans found use @Qualifier along with @Autowired to remove confusion

@Autowired
@Qualifier("studentOne")
private Student student;

Here, if more than one student beans are found, then bean with id, studentOne is autowired
