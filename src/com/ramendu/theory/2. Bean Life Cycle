* To define setup and teardown for a bean we simple declare the <bean> with initmethod and destroymethod parameters

* The init-method attribute specifies a method that is to be called on the bean immediately upon instantiation

* The destroy-method attribute specifies a method that is to be called on the bean immediately after destruction
