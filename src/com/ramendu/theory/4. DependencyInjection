* There are two variants of DI provided in Spring

    1. Constructor Based DI
    Constructor based DI is accomplished when the container invokes a class constructor with a number of arguments
    each representing a dependency on the other class

    2. Setter Based DI
    Setter based DI is accomplished when the container calls the setter method on your beans after invoking a no-arg
    constructor or no arg static factory method to instantiate the bean

* We can mix match both the Setter and DI injection, but it is a good rule of thumb to use constructor args for mandatory
dependencies and setters for optional dependencies
