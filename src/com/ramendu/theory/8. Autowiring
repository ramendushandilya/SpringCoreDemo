*. The Spring container can also autowire relationships between collaborating beans without using <constructor-arg>
and <property> tags

*. We can use "autowire" attribute of the bean tag to specify autowire mode for a bean definition

*. Below are the autowire modes

    1. no
    This is the default setting which means no autowiring and we need to do it explicitly

    2. byName
    Spring container looks at the properties of the beans on which autowire is set to "byName" in the XML configuration
    file. It then tries to match and wire its properties with beans defined in the configuration file

    3. byType
    Spring container looks at the properties of the beans on which autowire mode is set to "byType" in the XML config
    file. It then tries to match and wire a property if its type matches exactly with one of the beans name in config
    file. If more than one such bean is found exception is thrown

    4. constructor
    Similar to byType but applies to constructor arguments.

    5. autoDetect
    Spring first tries to autowire by constructor, if it doesn't work then it's done by type
